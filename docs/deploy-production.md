# Production Deploy Checklist (Render)

This guide covers hardening and deploying BettaPay Backend from `render.yaml`. Review every item before the first production Blueprint sync.

Related docs:

- [Render Blueprint Spec](https://render.com/docs/blueprint-spec)
- [Render Scaling](https://render.com/docs/scaling)

Each service exposes `GET /api/health` for readiness probes (gateway also has aggregated health when available).

---

## Pre-deploy: `render.yaml` review

### 1. CORS — `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (required)

- [ ] **Do not** set `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to `*`.
- [ ] Wildcard CORS is invalid with `credentials: true` (Fetch spec) and is rejected by production validation in `shared/validation/cors.ts`.
- [ ] In the Render Dashboard, set `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` on **api-gateway** to an explicit HTTPS frontend URL (comma-separated for multiple origins).

```text
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://betta-pay-frontend.vercel.app
# or
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://app.example.com,https://www.example.com
```

`sync: false` means Blueprint will not overwrite the value you set in the dashboard.

### 2. Inter-service auth — `INTER_SERVICE_SECRET` (required)

- [ ] Generate one strong secret (≥ 16 characters; prefer 32+).
- [ ] Set the **same** value on **all four** services: `api-gateway`, `fx-engine`, `settlement-engine`, `indexer`.
- [ ] Do **not** rely on `generateValue` on the gateway + `fromService` on private services for first-time deploy — that creates a chicken-and-egg race during Blueprint sync.

```bash
# Example local generation (do not commit the result)
openssl rand -hex 32
```

### 3. Health checks

- [ ] Confirm each service exposes `GET /api/health`.
- [ ] `healthCheckPath: /api/health` is set on all four services in `render.yaml`.
- [ ] Note: Render documents `healthCheckPath` as **web services only**. The public gateway uses it for zero-downtime deploys. Private services still expose `/api/health` for internal monitoring; Render may fall back to TCP checks for `pserv`.

Optional post-deploy probe (gateway public URL):

```bash
curl -sS https://<api-gateway-host>/api/health
curl -sS https://<api-gateway-host>/api/health/all
```

Expect `200` for `healthy` / `degraded`, `503` for `unhealthy`.

### 4. Plans and upgrade path

| Resource | Blueprint default | Production upgrade path |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| api-gateway | `starter` | starter → standard → pro |
| fx-engine | `starter` | starter → standard → pro |
| settlement-engine | `starter` | starter → standard → pro |
| indexer | `starter` | starter → standard → pro |
| Postgres (`bettapay-db`) | `free` | free → basic → pro |
| Redis (`bettapay-redis`) | `free` | free → starter → standard / pro |

- [ ] Confirm plan sizes match expected traffic and Redis/DB connection limits.
- [ ] Upgrade Postgres/Redis off `free` before production load.

### 5. High availability (`numInstances` / `scaling`)

- [ ] **api-gateway**: autoscaling with `minInstances: 2` (HA floor). If Pro autoscaling is unavailable, remove `scaling` and set `numInstances: 2`.
- [ ] **fx-engine / settlement-engine**: `numInstances: 2` + autoscaling block (Pro+). For cost-sensitive staging, set `numInstances: 1` and remove `scaling`.
- [ ] **indexer**: keep `numInstances: 1` until multi-instance cursor coordination exists. Documented HA path is `numInstances: 2` only after that work lands.
- [ ] Remember: when `scaling` is present, Render ignores `numInstances` for that service.

### 6. Autoscaling thresholds

Configured targets (Pro workspace required):

| Service | min | max | CPU | Memory |
|---------|-----|-----|-----|--------|
| api-gateway | 2 | 5 | 60% | 60% |
| fx-engine | 2 | 4 | 70% | 70% |
| settlement-engine | 2 | 4 | 70% | 70% |
| indexer | — | — | commented out | commented out |

- [ ] Confirm the workspace plan supports autoscaling (Pro+).
- [ ] If not on Pro, delete/comment `scaling` blocks and use manual `numInstances` instead.

### 7. Private services (`pserv`) networking

- [ ] `fx-engine`, `settlement-engine`, and `indexer` remain `type: pserv` (no public URL).
- [ ] Internal URLs (`http://fx-engine:3002`, etc.) are only reachable inside the Render private network.
- [ ] Render **project members** can still reach private services. Treat `INTER_SERVICE_SECRET`, `ADMIN_SECRET`, and DB credentials as sensitive regardless of `pserv`.
- [ ] Do not convert private engines to public `web` services.

### 8. Other `sync: false` secrets (required)

Set in the dashboard for every service that declares them:

- [ ] `SETTLEMENT_CONTRACT_ID`
- [ ] `GOVERNANCE_CONTRACT_ID`
- [ ] `ADMIN_ADDRESS` / `ADMIN_SECRET` (gateway + settlement)
- [ ] `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `JWT` settings if required by your env schema beyond Blueprint defaults

## First-time deploy order

1. Create / link the Blueprint from this repo’s `render.yaml`.
2. In the Render Dashboard, fill all `sync: false` env vars **before** (or immediately after) first sync — especially `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` and `INTER_SERVICE_SECRET`.
3. Sync Blueprint and wait for Postgres + Redis to become ready.
4. Deploy services; confirm gateway health:
   - `GET /api/health`
   - `GET /api/health/all` (aggregated downstream status)
5. Run Prisma migrations against production (`npx prisma migrate deploy`) if not covered by a pre-deploy command.
6. Smoke-test a merchant/payment path from the frontend origin listed in `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.

---

## Dashboard overrides

Render allows manual override of every env var at deploy time. Prefer dashboard values for secrets; keep non-secret wiring (`FX_ENGINE_URL`, ports, Stellar RPC defaults) in `render.yaml`.

After changing Blueprint scaling or plans, re-sync and verify the service Settings → Scaling page matches the intended HA/autoscaling config.

---

## Rollback / safety notes

- Zero-downtime deploys depend on a healthy `/api/health` for the public gateway.
- If a deploy fails CORS validation at boot, check that `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` is set and is not `*`.
- If inter-service calls return `401 UNAUTHORIZED`, verify `INTER_SERVICE_SECRET` matches on all four services.
